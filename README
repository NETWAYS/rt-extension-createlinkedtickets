NAME
    RT::Extension::CreateLinkedTickets

DESCRIPTION
    Allows to quickly create linked tickets based on templates.

    The extension adds configurable quick actions right under the "Links"
    widget in a ticket's overview.

    In order to avoid ticket creation noise (notifications to queue
    watchers) in the workflow, ticket creation must be confirmed.

RT VERSION
    Works with RT 4.4.2

REQUIREMENTS
    RT::Extension::TicketActions (>= 1.0.1)
        Provides "Font Awesome" icon integration.

INSTALLATION
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install
        May need root permissions

    Edit your /opt/rt4/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
        Add this line:

            Plugin('RT::Extension::CreateLinkedTickets');

    Clear your mason cache
            rm -rf /opt/rt4/var/mason_data/obj

    Restart your webserver

CONFIGURATION
    The only configuration option required by this extension is
    $CreateLinkedTickets_Config. This is a list of hashes each representing
    a quick action to show.

        Set($CreateLinkedTickets_Config, [
            {
                name     => 'clt-billing',    # Internal name used
                icon     => 'cart-plus',      # Font Awesome icon to use for the action
                title    => 'Billing Ticket', # Title which is visible in the action's tooltip
                template => 'CLT-Billing',    # Template for RT::Action::CreateTickets (<ID>|<NAME>)
            },
        ]);

    Additionally each of those hashes needs to reference a template that is
    passed to RT::Action::CreateTickets
    <https://docs.bestpractical.com/rt/4/RT/Action/CreateTickets.html>.

    For more information on how to write templates please refer to the
    official documentation linked above.

  Template Example
    Please note that this is a very basic example and should generally work.
    The only thing you need to adjust is the given Queue so that it's valid
    one.

            ===Create-Ticket: billing-ticket
            Subject: Billing: {$Tickets{'TOP'}->Subject}
            Refers-To: {$Tickets{'TOP'}->Id}
            Queue: Finance
            Content: Billing ticket for Ticket #{$Tickets{'TOP'}->Id} ({$Tickets{'TOP'}->Subject}) created.
            ENDOFCONTENT

    Just create this template by navigating to "Admin -> Global -> Templates
    -> Create", select Perl as type and give it CLT-Billing as name and
    you're good to go.
